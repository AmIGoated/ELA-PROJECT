                    <h3>Beginning</h3>
                    <p>Bill Gates was born in 1955 in Seattle, Washington. He showed an early interest in technology, especially when he encountered computers at 13 at Lakeside School. Gates and his friend Paul Allen quickly became fascinated with programming, spending countless hours learning and experimenting with code. This early exposure to computers sparked Gates's lifelong passion for technology and innovation, setting the foundation for his future career.</p>

                    <h3>Founding Microsoft</h3>
                    <p>In 1975, Gates and Allen founded Microsoft after they created a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair 8800 microcomputer. Seeing potential in software development, Gates secured a transformative deal with IBM to provide MS-DOS for IBM's first personal computers. This strategic licensing move made Microsoft a key player in the tech industry, and MS-DOS became the foundation of Microsoft's early success and dominance.!</p>

                    <h3>Transition to Philanthropy</h3>
                    <p>In 2000, Gates turned his focus to philanthropy. He and his then-wife, Melinda Gates, established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which would go on to become one of the world’s largest charitable organizations. Their foundation focuses on global health, education, and poverty alleviation, dedicating billions of dollars to these causes. This shift marked a new phase for Gates, who left his daily role at Microsoft to focus full-time on addressing global challenges.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Was it pure extraordinary talent?</h3>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Or was it something else?</h3>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>In "Outliers," Bill Gates's achievements highlight how important social conditions were to his success. He had access to a computer at a young age, which was rare in the 1970s, giving him unique opportunities to practice and learn programming. This early access allowed him to develop skills that others didn’t have the chance to, showing that his success wasn’t just due to his talent but also the special circumstances around him. Gladwell emphasizes that both hard work and the right opportunities play a huge role in achieving success, making it clear that Gates’s accomplishments were shaped by his environment as much as by his efforts.</p>
